Deep Learning course practicals

Here you can find my work or corrections on the practicals of the Deep Learning Course taught by Pr. Fleuret 

Website of the course: https://documents.epfl.ch/users/f/fl/fleuret/www/dlc/

Since I am currently passing the course, the practicals will be updated regulary.

For most of the work I usually use jupyter to run my scripts you can simply install it like this:
# python3 -m pip install jupyter
and run it by opening a terminal and navigating to the folder containing the script and typing:
# jupyter notebook
